# Trace-Case

With the increasing number of coronavirus cases day by day it's becoming hard to keep the track of records. So this application is built with a motive to serve the same purpose. It's a JAVA application built on the Spring Boot framework that lists the <b>total number of cases for the current day</b>, <b>cases reported since the previous day</b> globally.

## Requirements

- JDK 1.8 or later
- Intellij IDEA or Eclipse
- Maven 3.2+

## Run the application locally

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open in Intellij IDEA or Eclipse
3. Run <b>CoronavirusTrackerApplication.java</b> located at src/main/java/com/company/coronavirustracker/
4. Open http://localhost:8090/ in your browser. You'll be able to see the web app running as follows:
